The risk will be\nhighest across the Capital Region, the Lake George and Saratoga\nregion, as well as the mid Hudson Valley, Taconics and eastern\nCatskills.\n\nAny fires that develop in these areas could spread rapidly.\nResidents are encouraged to exercise caution if handling any\npotential ignition sources, such as machinery, cigarettes, or\nmatches. As a reminder, the annual statewide burn ban is in\neffect until May 14. No burn permits are issued.\n\nFor more information about wildfire danger and wildfire\nprevention, please visit the New York Department of Environmental\nConservation website at http://dec.ny.gov/environmental-\nprotection/wildfires.",
