The risk will be\nhighest over southern Herkimer, Montgomery, and Schoharie Counties\nin the Leatherstocking Fire Danger Rating Area, and in Warren,\nSaratoga, and Washington Counties in the Upper Hudson\nValley/Champlain Fire Danger Rating Area.\n\nAny fires that develop in dry grass or brush will likely spread\nrapidly. Outdoor burning is strongly discouraged, and residents\nare urged to exercise caution if handling any potential ignition\nsources, such as machinery, cigarettes, or matches. The annual\nstatewide burn ban is in effect until May 14. No burn permits are\nissued.\n\nFor more information about wildfire danger and wildfire prevention,\nplease visit the New York Department of Environmental\nConservation website at http://dec.ny.gov/environmental-\nprotection/wildfires.",
