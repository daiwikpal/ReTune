to 35 to 45 mph. An isolated gust to 50 mph will be possible.

Outdoor burning is strongly discouraged, and residents are urged
to exercise caution if handling any potential ignition sources,
such as machinery, cigarettes, or matches. The annual statewide
burn ban is in effect until May 14. No burn permits are issued.

Saratoga, and Washington Counties in the Upper Hudson
Valley/Champlain Fire Danger Rating Area.
